NN578_network2.py
==============

Modified from the NNDL book code "network2.py".

network2.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An improved version of network.py, implementing the stochastic
gradient descent learning algorithm for a feedforward neural network.
Improvements include the addition of the cross-entropy cost function,
regularization, and better initialization of network weights.  Note
that I have focused on making the code simple, easily readable, and
easily modifiable.  It is not optimized, and omits many desirable
features.

        The flag ``convert`` should be set to False if the data set is
        validation or test data (the usual case), and to True if the
        data set is the training data. The need for this flag arises
        due to differences in the way the results ``y`` are
        represented in the different data sets.  In particular, it
        flags whether we need to convert between the different
        representations.  It may seem strange to use different
        representations for the different data sets.  Why not use the
        same representation for all three data sets?  It's done for
        efficiency reasons -- the program usually evaluates the cost
        on the training data and the accuracy on other data sets.
        These are different types of computations, and using different
        representations speeds things up.  More details on the
        representations can be found in
